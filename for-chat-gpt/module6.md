# Module 6 Prompt Patterns III



## Exercise

Develop your own prompt-based application, similar to the outlining application from the videos, to help you accomplish a task.

Come up with a creative way of using large language models to program an environment to solve a problem you face on a daily basis.

Provide your prompt and a sample of using the prompt-based application.
