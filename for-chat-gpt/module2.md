# Prompts, Conversations, & New Information

## Introduce new information

GPT 3.5 trained on information since 2021. Give new information since then. Provide rules or assumptions.

Search engines will pull in documents and put them into the prompt.

## Size limitation

Provide the most important information.

Considerations

1. Subset of information that is relevant
2. Filtering of extraneous material
3. Summarizing or compress before giving to LLM. Afterward have LLM summarize further.


## Prompts are a Tool for Repeated Use

Asking follow up questions, refining, problem solving as sort of chiseling the rock with a hammer rather than hitting a nail on the head.

## Root Prompts

Providing a seed that will influence everything that comes later.
